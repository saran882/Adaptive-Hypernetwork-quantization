# Title: Personal Finance Advisor
#
# Description:
# This script applies the Multi-Agent framework to the Finance domain.
# It creates a team of two experts:
# 1. Financial Planner: Focuses on SAVING (budgeting, cutting costs, timelines).
# 2. Investment Advisor: Focuses on GROWING (stocks, bonds, risk tolerance).
#
# By splitting "Finance" into "Saving" vs "Investing", we get a holistic
# financial strategy that covers both defense (saving) and offense (investing).
#
