# Title: Travel Itinerary Planner
#
# Description:
# This script applies the Multi-Agent concept to the Travel domain.
# It creates a "Travel Agency" team:
# 1. Planner: Focuses on logistics, schedule, and structure.
# 2. Local Expert: Focuses on culture, hidden gems, and specific recommendations.
#
# This shows how breaking a complex problem (planning a vacation) into
# distinct perspectives (Logistics vs. Experience) yields a richer result.
#
# Installation:
# pip install streamlit crewai langchain-community
#
# How to run:
# streamlit run 28.py
