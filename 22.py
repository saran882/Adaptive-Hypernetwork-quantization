# Title: Chat with Your Note
#
# Description:
# This is a "Personal Knowledge Base" application.
# It allows the user to:
# 1. SAVE snippets of text (notes) into a permanent storage file (`note.text`).
# 2. ASK questions about anything they have previously saved.
#
# It uses the same RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) logic as the previous lesson,
# but adds the ability to accumulate data over time rather than pasting it all at once.
#
# Installation:
# pip install streamlit==1.33.0 langchain==0.2.16 langchain-community==0.2.17 spacy==3.7.4
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
#
# How to run:
# streamlit run 22.py
#
# Note: Ensure you create an empty file named "note.text" in the folder before running.
