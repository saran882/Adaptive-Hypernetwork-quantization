# Title: Text-to-Speech with Qwen TTS
#
# Description:
# This script demonstrates how to use a specialized Text-to-Speech (TTS) model.
# We are using "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice".
#
# Unlike generic models, some specialized models require their own libraries (like 'qwen_tts')
# or specific configurations.
#
# Troubleshooting:
# If you see errors about "FlashAttention", it means your computer is missing a specific
# optimization library that is hard to install on Windows. We disable it below to ensure compatibility.
#
# Installation:
# pip install torch soundfile transformers accelerate qwen_tts
#
# How to run:
# python 33.py

import torch
import soundfile as sf
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSModel

# Initialize the model.
# .from_pretrained() downloads the model weights from Hugging Face.
model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice",
    # device_map="auto": Automatically puts the model on GPU if available, otherwise CPU.
    device_map="auto",
    # dtype=torch.bfloat16: Uses Brain Floating Point format (good for newer GPUs).
    # If you get an error here on older GPUs, change it to torch.float16 or torch.float32.
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    # attn_implementation="flash_attention_2", # <--- REMOVED/COMMENTED OUT
    # We removed this line because 'flash_attn' is hard to install on Windows.
    # The model will now use the standard, compatible attention mechanism.

# Save the result to a WAV file

# --- Batch Inference ---
# Generating audio for multiple sentences at once (faster than loop).
print("Generating batch audio...")

        "其实我真的有发现，我是一个特别善于观察别人情绪的人。",

# Save the batch results
sf.write("output_custom_voice_1.wav", wavs[0], sr)
sf.write("output_custom_voice_2.wav", wavs[1], sr)
print("Saved batch outputs.")

# --- Advanced Usage: Controlling Style & Randomness ---
# Just like text LLMs, TTS models have parameters to control "creativity" or stability.
#
# Key Parameters:
# 1. temperature (default 0.9): 
#    - Lower (e.g., 0.1): More stable, robotic, consistent pronunciation.
#    - Higher (e.g., 1.0+): More expressive, emotional, but potentially unstable (mumbling).
#
# 2. top_p (default 1.0):
#    - Controls the "nucleus sampling". Reducing it (e.g., 0.8) can make speech clearer
#      by ignoring unlikely acoustic tokens.
#
# 3. repetition_penalty (default 1.05):
#    - Prevents the model from getting stuck in a loop (e.g., "Hello hello hello...").
#    - Increase slightly (e.g., 1.1 or 1.2) if you hear stuttering.

wavs, sr = model.generate_custom_voice(

    max_new_tokens=4096     # Allow for longer speech generation if needed
