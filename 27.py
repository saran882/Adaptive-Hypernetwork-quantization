# Title: Recipe Generator and Nutrition Analyzer
#
# Description:
# This script reinforces the "Sequential Workflow" concept with a new domain: Cooking.
# 1. Agent 1 (Chef): Creates something new (a recipe).
# 2. Agent 2 (Nutritionist): Analyzes the output of Agent 1.
#
# This pattern (Creator -> Analyst) is extremely common in AI applications.
#
# Installation:
# pip install streamlit crewai langchain-community
#
# How to run:
# streamlit run 27.py
