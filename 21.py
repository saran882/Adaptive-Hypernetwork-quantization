# Title: Get Model Answer Questions Based on Long Stories
#
# Description:
# This is a full "RAG" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built from scratch!
# The problem: We have a very long text (too big for the LLM). We want to ask a question.
# The solution:
# 1. SPLIT the text into chunks.
# 2. SEARCH: Compare the user's question to every chunk (using SpaCy embeddings).
# 3. FILTER: Pick only the top 3 most relevant chunks.
# 4. ANSWER: Send ONLY those 3 relevant chunks to Llama 3 to get the final answer.
#
# This saves money/compute and improves accuracy by removing irrelevant noise.
#
# Installation:
# pip install streamlit==1.33.0 langchain==0.2.16 langchain-community==0.2.17 spacy==3.7.4
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
#
# How to run:
# streamlit run 21.py
