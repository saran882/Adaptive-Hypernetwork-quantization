# Title: Chat with Your Diary
#
# Description:
# This is an advanced variation of the "Chat with Note" app.
# Instead of storing everything in a messy text file, we use a STRUCTURED data format: JSON.
#
# Key Features:
# 1. Date-Based Storage: Notes are saved with the date as the key (e.g., "2023-10-27": "Went to the park").
# 2. Structured Retrieval: We can access specific days easily.
# 3. JSON Persistence: Using Python's `json` library to save/load the dictionary to a file.
#
# Installation:
# pip install streamlit==1.33.0 langchain==0.2.16 langchain-community==0.2.17 spacy==3.7.4
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
#
# How to run:
# streamlit run 23.py
#
# Note: Ensure you have a file named "diary.json" containing at least "{}" (empty JSON object)
# in the folder before running, or the script might error on first load.
