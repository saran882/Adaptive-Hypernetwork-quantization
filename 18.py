# Title: Learn Chunking Long Texts
#
# Description:
# This script tackles a common problem: "Context Window Limits".
# LLMs cannot read infinite amounts of text at once. If you try to summarize a whole book,
# the model will crash or cut off the text.
#
# The solution is "Chunking":
# 1. Split the long text into smaller pieces (chunks).
# 2. Summarize each chunk individually.
# 3. Combine those small summaries into one final summary (Map-Reduce approach).
#
# Installation:
# pip install streamlit==1.33.0 langchain==0.2.16 langchain-community==0.2.17
#
# How to run:
# streamlit run 18.py
