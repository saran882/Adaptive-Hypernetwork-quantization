# Title: Story Writing with CrewAI and Ollama
#
# Description:
# This script demonstrates a multi-agent workflow: "Sequential Process".
# We have two specialized agents:
# 1. WRITER: Creates the initial draft.
# 2. EDITOR: Reviews and improves the draft.
#
# The output of the first task (Writing) is automatically passed as input
# to the second task (Editing), simulating a real-world content creation pipeline.
#
# Installation:
# pip install streamlit crewai langchain-community
#
# How to run:
# streamlit run 26.py
