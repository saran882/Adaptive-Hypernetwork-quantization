# SkyReels-V2 — Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video single-file runner
#
# Run:  python 36.py   (after editing the CONFIG section below)
# First run: clones SkyReels-V2 repo next to this script and installs dependencies.
# Prerequisites: NVIDIA GPU, PyTorch with CUDA, git. Output: output.mp4 in this script's folder.

# ---------- PARAMETERS QUICK REFERENCE (how they affect the result) ----------
# CONFIG (top): PROMPT (what and who), DURATION_SECONDS (length → frame count), SEED (reproducibility),
#   IMAGE_PATH (start image → I2V), END_IMAGE_PATH (end image → DF only), I2V_INFERENCE_STEPS (25 vs 50).
# SECTION 2: fps (playback only), base_num_frames (DF chunk size), overlap_history (chunk overlap),
#   height/width (resolution), guidance_scale (prompt strength), shift (noise schedule), inference_steps,
#   negative_prompt (what to avoid). See inline comments for each.
