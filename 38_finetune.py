# Fine-tune SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct with personal data using Unsloth + QLoRA
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT IS FINE-TUNING?
#   A pre-trained LLM (like SmolLM2) already knows language, grammar, and
#   general knowledge. But it doesn't know about YOU. Fine-tuning teaches the
#   model new facts by showing it Q&A examples (your personal data) and
#   adjusting a small portion of its weights so it can answer correctly.
#
# WHAT IS QLoRA?
#   Instead of updating ALL 1.7 billion parameters (which would need ~14 GB
#   of VRAM), QLoRA keeps the base model frozen in 4-bit precision and only
#   trains tiny "adapter" matrices attached to each layer. This cuts VRAM
#   to ~4-6 GB while achieving nearly the same quality as full fine-tuning.
#
# DATASET STRATEGY:
#   - TRAIN on 100% of personal_data.json (no knowledge lost).
#   - VALIDATE on a separate file (personal_data_val.json) containing
#     general-knowledge questions the base model already answers correctly.
#     This acts as a "catastrophic forgetting detector": if the model starts
#     losing its general abilities, the validation loss will rise.
#
# Install (if not already):
#   pip install unsloth
#   pip install trl datasets
#
# Run:
#   python 38_finetune.py
#
# After training, the LoRA adapters are saved to ./personal_model/
# Use 39_test_finetuned.py to test the fine-tuned model.

# shift slightly, so the corrections no longer line up perfectly. This causes
# quality loss when exporting to Ollama (double quantization: NF4→bf16→q8_0).
#
# When set to False (16-bit), the base weights are exact during training AND

# --- LoRA hyperparameters ---------------------------------------------------

# gets added to the original weights.

# LORA_R (rank): The inner dimension of the A and B matrices.
# Think of it as "how much new knowledge can the adapter store."
#   - r=16: 16 dimensions → smaller, faster, less capacity (good for small data).
#   - r=64: 64 dimensions → bigger, slower, more capacity (better for larger data).
# With 69 training examples, r=16 is sufficient. Too high risks memorizing noise.
LORA_R = 16 if LOW_RESOURCE else 64

# LORA_ALPHA: Controls how strongly the LoRA correction affects the model.
# The actual scaling factor is (alpha / r). With alpha=16 and r=16, the scale
# is 1.0, meaning the LoRA correction is applied at full strength.
# If alpha=32 and r=16, scale=2.0 → corrections are doubled (more aggressive).
# Rule of thumb: set alpha = r for a balanced starting point.
LORA_ALPHA = 16 if LOW_RESOURCE else 64

# LORA_DROPOUT/bye: Probability of randomly zeroing out LoRA activations during
# training. Dropout is a regularization technique that prevents overfitting
# by forcing the model to not rely too heavily on any single connection.
# 0 = no dropout. Unsloth uses an optimized code path when dropout=0.
# For very small datasets, you might try 0.05 or 0.1 if overfitting is severe.

#      - These help the model decide which words to "pay attention to" when generating.
#   2. FFN (Feed-Forward Network): has gate_proj, up_proj, down_proj
#      - These store factual knowledge and do the "thinking" after attention.
# By adding LoRA to ALL of them, the model can learn both new attention patterns
# (how to connect "Abdurrahman" with "NUAA") and new facts (the actual information).
